# Event_report_application_Android  
This is a event report android application for users to post events and search nearby events based on tags

# Initial Design
Used google Map API to display nearby hot events and navigate to the event  
Users can post their events with their geo-index  
Adding AdMob into this mobile app might be a little interesting
